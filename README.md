# What is Life of Flying?
Well its a simple MySQL script for the scripters that like scripting some gamemodes of Flying/Pilot'ing/Airlines.
Its fully based on MySQL.
So I will be uploading files soon.

# How to setup and connect the server?
Well if you are trying the script or getting a view how it works, then I suggest you to use XAMPP, which is the best for us.
First of all make sure your ports 80 and 3360 are open, if they are not close skype etc that's occupied by port 80,
So, if you have a user named root and without password, just open the script, make sure you started mysql and apache.
If not make a new user yourself add a password assign it to database you make upload the .sql file provided, then enter entries in .pwn file.
Start the server
Enjoy.

# How to set myself admin?
Well use the RCON feature.
Either use http://localhost/phpmyadmin                         (Recommended for users running on localhost)
Then click on the db you made, open it, go to table named users,
Find yourself
And set admin/vip to 7 or 6.
And press CTRL+F in the script and search /gimmeadmin
And remove my name and add yours.
Have a nice day, Happy Flying.
